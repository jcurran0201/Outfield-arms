# Outfield-arms 
## The purpose of this project was to find correlations between MLB outfielders' defensive runs saved and outs above average to their arm strength metrics. An additional purpose the project was to attempt to create a new defensive metric by combining defensive runs saved and outs above average to help better evaluate an outfielder's defensive value. 
## It was discovered that arm strength metrics were not heavily correlated with defensive runs saved. The max arm strength was the most correlated metric to defensive runs saved with a correlation of 0.207474. The results were very simialr for arm strength and outs above average. Max arm strength was slightly more correlated to Outs above average than it was to defensive runs saved witha correlation of 0.2298644.  
## The new defensive metric that was created was the mean of Defensive runs saved and Outs above average (DRS+OAA)/2). This new metric was proven to be a step in the right direction due to the the new metric being heavily correlated to both DRS and OAA.

### The new metric had a correlation of about 0.92 to Defensive runs saved. 
## ![Defensive value vs OAA](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/942a25ff-84a5-4c24-b7f3-65ec53bb2d66)
### The new metric had a correlation of about 0.85 to Outs above average 

## Both OAA and DRS being heavily correlated to the new metrics and helped better evaluate players who had a lot of variacne between their OAA and DRS. It helps discover if the player's effecitivenss in the field is from their arm strength or their ability to run down batted balls most players cannot. For example, Fernando Tatis Jr. Had a DRS of 27 and an OAA of 9. His new defensive value created was 18. The large gap in DRS and OAA might have hurt his defensive value, but it helped discover that while he is able to run down balls many outfielders cannot get to, the majority of his defensive value is coming from his arm strength, which averaged out other almost 97 MPH. In Julio Rodriguez's case, we discovered that despite having one of the best OAAs in baseball, his defensive value should be called into question because of his negavite DRS pulling down his defensive value. Discovering that such a talented player such as Julio Rodriguez is not as much of a defensive asset has his talent and OAA suggests he should be can result in further investigation to how he can improve his defense.  
## The flaw in this new stat is that it has the possibility of suggesting that some players are not quite as good or bad on defense as they truly are. One player who is hurt by this metric is Steven Kwan. Kwan has a DRS of 16 and an OAA of 9 while his defensive value is only rated at 12.5. Kwan has a strong arm and covers a more ground than many of his peers.  
## The verdict of this new stat is while it's certianly not perfect in accuratly evaluating every player's defensive ability, it can be used to help discover which players have a weakness in their defensive game and then  investigate of how to improve the player's defensive production.
